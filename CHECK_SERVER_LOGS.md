# üîç Check Server Logs for the Real Error

## The 500 Error Means:

You ARE logged in ‚úÖ, but the server is crashing when trying to fetch campaigns.

## What to Do:

### Step 1: Restart Server with Logs Visible
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Try to Load Dashboard
1. Visit http://localhost:3000/dashboard
2. Watch the terminal where `npm run dev` is running
3. Look for error messages

### Step 3: Look for These Patterns:

#### Pattern 1: Firestore Error
```
‚ùå Failed to initialize Firestore: ...
```
**Means:** Firebase credentials are wrong

**Fix:**
- Check `.env` has correct `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`, `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`
- Make sure private key has `\n` for newlines

#### Pattern 2: Missing Index
```
The query requires an index...
```
**Means:** Firestore needs an index created

**Fix:**
- Click the link in the error message
- It will open Firebase Console
- Click "Create Index"
- Wait 2-3 minutes
- Try again

#### Pattern 3: Permission Denied
```
Missing or insufficient permissions
```
**Means:** Firestore rules or service account permissions

**Fix:**
- Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí Rules
- Make sure service account has permissions

#### Pattern 4: Asset Loading Error
```
Missing frame asset...
```
**Means:** Campaign has invalid asset reference

**Fix:**
- This happens if you created campaigns before fixing storage
- Delete old campaigns from Firestore
- Create new campaigns

### Step 4: Share the Error

Copy the error from terminal and share it. The logs now show:
- ‚úÖ Which step is failing
- ‚úÖ What user ID is being used
- ‚úÖ How many campaigns were found
- ‚úÖ What assets are being loaded
