# Development Mode - Email Display Fix

## âœ… Fixed: Shows Your Real Email Now

The app was showing `demo@phrames.com` because the development mode session wasn't storing your actual email. This has been fixed!

### What Changed

**Before:**
- Session stored only Firebase UID
- Hardcoded `demo@phrames.com` as fallback
- Your real email wasn't displayed

**After:**
- Session stores both UID and email: `firebase-dev-session-{uid}|{email}`
- Shows your actual Firebase email
- Works with both email/password and Google Sign-In

### How to See Your Real Email

1. **Clear your current session:**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Application â†’ Cookies
   - Delete the `session-id` cookie
   - Or just logout and login again

2. **Login again:**
   - Go to `/login`
   - Sign in with email/password OR Google
   - âœ… Your real email will now show in the header!

### Session Format

**Development Mode:**
```
Cookie: session-id=firebase-dev-session-abc123|user@gmail.com
                                      â†‘        â†‘
                                     UID     Email
```

**Production Mode (with database):**
```
Cookie: session-id=uuid-from-database
```

### Testing

1. **Email/Password:**
   ```
   Login with: test@example.com
   Shows: test@example.com âœ…
   ```

2. **Google Sign-In:**
   ```
   Login with: yourname@gmail.com
   Shows: yourname@gmail.com âœ…
   ```

### Why This Matters

- âœ… Shows correct user identity
- âœ… Better testing experience
- âœ… Matches production behavior
- âœ… No confusion with demo data

**Your real email will now display correctly!** ðŸŽ‰
