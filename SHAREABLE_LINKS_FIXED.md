# ✅ Shareable Links Fixed!

## What Was Wrong

The public campaign endpoint was trying to use S3 utilities that don't exist anymore. It's now fixed to work with both local storage and Firebase Storage.

## What I Fixed

### Files Modified:
1. **server/api/public/campaigns/[slug].get.ts**
   - Removed S3 dependency
   - Now uses URLs directly from campaign object
   - Works with both local and Firebase Storage

2. **server/utils/storage.ts**
   - Returns storage key (not full URL)
   - Consistent with how Firebase Storage works

3. **server/utils/firestore.ts**
   - Smart URL detection
   - Handles local storage paths (`frames/`, `thumbs/`)
   - Handles Firebase Storage URLs
   - Converts to correct public URL

4. **server/api/assets/[...path].get.ts**
   - Better path detection
   - Handles `frames/` and `thumbs/` prefixes
   - Redirects to correct location

## How to Test

### 1. Restart Server
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### 2. Create a Campaign (if you haven't)
1. Visit http://localhost:3000
2. Log in
3. Dashboard → Create Campaign
4. Fill in details and upload PNG
5. Click "Create Campaign"

### 3. Test Shareable Link
1. On campaign management page, click **Copy Link**
2. Open link in new incognito/private window
3. You should see:
   - ✅ Campaign name and description
   - ✅ Frame image loaded
   - ✅ Upload area for photos
   - ✅ No errors!

### 4. Test Image Composition
1. Upload a test photo
2. Drag to reposition
3. Use zoom slider
4. Click "Download PNG"
5. ✅ Should download composed image!

## URL Structure

### Local Storage:
```
Campaign: /c/my-campaign
Frame: /uploads/frames/user123/1234567890-abc.png
Thumb: /uploads/thumbs/user123/1234567890-abc.png
```

### Firebase Storage (when enabled):
```
Campaign: /c/my-campaign
Frame: https://storage.googleapis.com/bucket/frames/user123/...
Thumb: https://storage.googleapis.com/bucket/thumbs/user123/...
```

## Complete Flow

### 1. Creator Creates Campaign:
```
Fill form → Upload PNG → Validate → Store in public/uploads/
→ Save to Firestore → Get shareable link
```

### 2. Creator Shares Link:
```
Copy link: http://localhost:3000/c/my-campaign
Share via: Social media, email, QR code, etc.
```

### 3. User Visits Link:
```
Visit /c/my-campaign → Load campaign data → Display frame
→ User uploads photo → Compose in browser → Download
```

### 4. Analytics Tracked:
```
Visit → Record in Firestore
Upload photo → Record render
Download → Record download
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Campaign Not Found"
**Check:**
1. Campaign was created successfully
2. Slug is correct in URL
3. Campaign status is "active"
4. Check Firestore for campaign data

### Frame image not loading
**Check:**
1. Image exists in `public/uploads/frames/`
2. Check browser network tab for 404 errors
3. Try accessing image URL directly
4. Check file permissions

### "Internal server error"
**Check:**
1. Server logs for errors
2. Browser console for errors
3. Firestore connection working
4. Storage path is correct
