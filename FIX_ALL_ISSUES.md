# 🔧 Fix ALL Issues at Once

## I've Created a Complete System Test

This will identify EVERY issue in your system and tell you exactly how to fix each one.

---

## Step 1: Visit the Test Page

```
http://localhost:3000/test-system
```

This page will automatically:
1. ✅ Check environment variables
2. ✅ Check Firebase Admin
3. ✅ Check Firestore connection
4. ✅ Check storage directories
5. ✅ Check authentication
6. ✅ Check campaign queries

---

## Step 2: Read the Results

The page will show:
- **Green ✅** = Working
- **Red ❌** = Broken
- **Orange ⚠️** = Error
- **Gray ⏭️** = Skipped

For each failed test, it shows:
- What's wrong
- How to fix it
- Exact commands to run

---

## Step 3: Fix Issues in Order

The page lists action items in priority order. Fix them one by one:

### Issue 1: Environment Variables Missing
**Fix:**
```bash
# Edit .env file
nano .env

# Add missing variables (shown in test results)
# Restart server
npm run dev
```

### Issue 2: Firebase Admin Failed
**Fix:**
- Check FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
- Check FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL  
- Check FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY (must have \n for newlines)
- Restart server

**Fix:**

### Issue 5: Authentication Failed

### Issue 6: Campaign Query Failed
**Fix:**
- Usually a Firestore index issue

---

## Step 4: Run Test Again

After fixing each issue:
1. Click "Run Complete System Test" again
2. Check if more issues appear
3. Fix them
4. Repeat until all tests pass ✅
