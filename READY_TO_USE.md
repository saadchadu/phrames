# ✅ Phrames - Ready to Use!

## What's Been Fixed

### 1. Authentication Flow ✅
- Added Firebase token to all API requests
- Fixed `useApi` composable to include auth headers
- All protected endpoints now receive proper authentication

### 2. Campaign Creation ✅
- Complete flow: Name → Slug → Description → Image Upload
- Automatic slug generation from campaign name
- PNG validation (transparency, size requirements)
- S3 upload for frame and thumbnail
- Firestore database storage

### 3. Shareable Links ✅
- Each campaign gets a unique URL: `/c/[slug]`
- Copy link button on campaign management page
- Public access (no login required for users)
- Full URL shown in campaign metadata

### 4. Image Composition ✅
- Client-side canvas rendering
- Drag to reposition photo
- Zoom slider (10% - 300%)
- Download as PNG or JPEG
- No server processing - all in browser

### 5. Missing Endpoints Created ✅
- `GET /api/assets/[...path]` - Serve images from S3
- `POST /api/campaigns/[id]/archive` - Archive campaigns
- `POST /api/campaigns/[id]/unarchive` - Unarchive campaigns

### 6. Configuration ✅
- Added @nuxt/ui to modules
- All environment variables documented
